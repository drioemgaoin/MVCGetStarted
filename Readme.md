# Application lifecycle
MVC Application lifecycle contains two events:
- Start event: fired when the application is brought to life by a very first request to the application. 
- End event: fired when the application has been shut down.

![Application Lifecycle](./img/application-lifecycle.jpg)

MVC application provide two handlers to these events in Global.asax file. Start handler is usually used to register all areas of MVC application, installing global filters, adding routes and bundles.


# Request lifecycle
![Request Lifecycle](./img/request-lifecycle.jpg)

## Routing

### Url Routing Module
It analyses the request and looks up Routing table to find the controller the incoming request maps to.

![Url Routing Module](./img/url-routing-module.jpg)

It analyses the request and makes the route selection. It loops through the RouteData from a RouteTable and selects the first route which matches the current URL. If no routes found then the Url Routing Module sends the request to regular ASP.NET or IIS request processing.

![Route Selection](./img/route-selection.jpg)

Routes are added in the start handler in the Global.asax file. You have many way to add them:
- Use Route object
```C#
var routeValue = new RouteValueDictionary
{
    { "Controller", "Home" },
    { "Action", "Index" }
};
routes.Add(new Route("home", routeValue, new MvcRouteHandler()));
```
- Use MapRoute from the RouteCollection object
```C#
routes.MapRoute(
    name: "Default",
    url: "{controller}/{action}/{id}",
    defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional }
```
- Use MapMvcAttributeRoutes
```C#
routes.MapMvcAttributeRoutes();

public class HomeController : Controller
{
    [Route("Home", Name = "Index")]
    public ActionResult Index()
    {
        return View();
    }
}
```

You can define constraints to a route by using:
- Regular expressions
  - Using MapRoute
    ```C#
    routes.MapRoute(
        name: "RegExpRouteConstraint",
        url: "TestRouteConstraint/Regexp/{user}",
        defaults: new { controller = "TestRouteConstraint", action = "RegularExpressionConstraint", user = UrlParameter.Optional },
        constraints: new { user = "rdiegoni" } // 'user' identifies the parameter that the constraint applies to
    );

    // localhost/TestRouteConstraint/Custom/rdiegoni resource found
    // localhost/TestRouteConstraint/Custom/xxx resource not found
    ```

  - Using RouteAttribute
    ```C#
    [Route("TestRouteConstraint/Regexp/{user:regex(rdiegoni)}", Name = "TestRouteConstraint_RegularExpressionConstraint")]
    public ActionResult RegularExpressionConstraint(string user)
    {
        ViewBag.Message = "Regular Expression Constraint sucess";
        return View("Result");
    }
    ```

- Objects that implement the IRouteConstraint interface 
    ```C#
    public class CustomRouteConstraint: IRouteConstraint
    {
        private readonly List<string> users;

        public CustomRouteConstraint(string users)
        {
            this.users = users.Split('|').Select(x => x.ToLower()).ToList();
        }

        public bool Match(
            HttpContextBase httpContext, 
            Route route, 
            string parameterName, 
            RouteValueDictionary values,
            RouteDirection routeDirection)
        {
            var value = values[parameterName].ToString();
            return users.Contains(value.ToLower());
        }
    }
    ```

    Then, register it in Global.asax file
    ```C#
    var constraintsResolver = new DefaultInlineConstraintResolver();
    constraintsResolver.ConstraintMap.Add("match", typeof(CustomRouteConstraint));
    ```

  - Using MapRoute
    ```C#
    routes.MapRoute(
        name: "CustomRouteConstraint",
        url: "TestRouteConstraint/Custom/{user}",
        defaults: new { controller = "TestRouteConstraint", action = "CustomRouteConstraint", user = UrlParameter.Optional },
        constraints: new { user = new CustomRouteConstraint("rdiegoni") } // 'user' identifies the parameter that the constraint applies to
    );
    ```

  - Using RouteAttribute
    ```C#
    [Route("TestRouteConstraint/Custom/{user:match(rdiegoni)}", Name = "TestRouteConstraint_CustomRouteConstraint")]
    public ActionResult CustomRouteConstraint(string user)
    {
        ViewBag.Message = "Custom Route Constraint sucess";
        return View("Result");
    }
    ```

### Route Handler
It is a class returning the http handler that will handle the incoming request.

To create a new route handler, you need to create a class that derives from IRouteHandler and return an instance of the custom handler in the GetHttpHandler method.
```C#
public class CustomRouteHandler : IRouteHandler
{
    public IHttpHandler GetHttpHandler(RequestContext requestContext)
    {
        return new CustomHttpHandler();
    }
}
```

Then, you need to associate this handler to the routes you want to apply with.
```C#
routes.Add(new Route("route", new CustomRouteHandler()));
```

MVC uses MVCRouteHandler as a default route handler.

### Http Handler

It is a class that provides a response to the incoming request. 

To create a custom http handler, you need to create a class that derives from IHttpHandler.
```C#
public class CustomHttpHandler: IHttpHandler
{
    public void ProcessRequest(HttpContext context)
    {
        context.Response.Redirect("https://github.com/drioemgaoin", true);
    }
}
```

MVC uses MVCHttpHandler as a default http handler. It is the entry point of MVC framework.

There are two sets of events in the MVC request lifecycle that concerns HttpHandlers:
- MapRequestHandler and PostMapRequestHandler: determines the httpHandler responsible for executing the request. Only the selection happens during this time.
- RequestHandlerExecute and PostRequestHandlerExecute: executes the htttp handler determined in the earlier phases of request lifecycle.

![Route Selection](./img/http-handler.jpg)


## Controller Initialization
![Route Selection](./img/controller-initialization.jpg)

Once the http handler determinated, it starts to process the request by inspecting the RequestContext to get the name of the Controller from the URL. 

Then, it uses the ControllerBuilder to get the ControllerFactory instance. 

Then, it passes the name of the Controller and RequestContext to the CreateController (ControllerFactory method) to create the controller by using Controller Activator and Dependency Resolver. If no dependency resolved was found then Controller Activator manually creates an instance of controller and returns it for execution. Once the controller has been initialized MvcHandler calls controller.Execute() method to begin processing execution.

Finally, it calls the controller’s Execute method and passes the RequestContext to Controller.

MVC uses DefaultControllerFactory as a default controller factory. 

To create a custom controller factory, you need to:
- Create a class that derives from IControllerFactory (or DefaultControllerFactory).
```C#
public class CustomControllerFactory : IControllerFactory
{
    // You can use your favourite IoC tool to inject the dependencies needed by each controller
    // Activator.CreateInstance(controller, dependencies)

    public IController CreateController(RequestContext requestContext, string controllerName)
    {
        var controllername = $"{requestContext.RouteData.Values["controller"]}Controller";

        var controllers = GetControllers();
        var controller = controllers.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Name == controllername);
        if (controller != null)
        {
            return Activator.CreateInstance(controller) as IController;
        }

        return null;
    }

    public SessionStateBehavior GetControllerSessionBehavior(RequestContext requestContext, string controllerName)
    {
        return SessionStateBehavior.Default;
    }

    public void ReleaseController(IController controller)
    {
        var dispose = controller as IDisposable;
        dispose?.Dispose();
    }

    private static IEnumerable<Type> GetControllers()
    {
        var myAssembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
        return myAssembly.GetTypes()
            .Where(x => x.IsClass && x.Name.EndsWith("Controller")).ToList();
    }
}
```
- Set this factory as a new controller factory in Global.asax file.
```C#
ControllerBuilder.Current.SetControllerFactory(typeof(CustomControllerFactory));
```

## Action Execution
![Route Selection](./img/action-execution.jpg)

Once the controller has been chosen and initialized, execution start by using an Action Invoker that will select appropriate method using route data and method names.

Once the selection is done, Authentication filters fires to ensure that current user is authenticated. If the authentication fails then a challenge is sent back to the use, which could involve redirect user to a login page. If the authentication passes, request moves ahead with authorization filter. Once again, the same process happens, if the user is not authorized, then a challenge is sent back to browser, otherwise request pipeline moves.

Once the authentication and authorization are passed, request moves to the model binding step which collects data from query string, route data and request to generate objects required by Action method.

Once the model binding has been done, Action filters are triggered. Before action method is executed, an action filter is executed (OnActionExecuting) and after action method is executed, an action filter is executed (OnActionExecuted).

### Action Invoker
It has the responsibilities of finding the action method in the controller and then invoking the action method.

To create a custom action invoker, you need to:
- Create a class that derives from IActionInvoker (or ControllerActionInvoker)
```C#
public class CustomControllerActionInvoker: IActionInvoker
{
    public bool InvokeAction(ControllerContext controllerContext, string actionName)
    {
        var view = new StringBuilder();
        view.Append("<div>");
        view.Append("Content generated by my custom controller action invoker");
        view.Append("</div>");
        controllerContext.HttpContext.Response.Write(view.ToString());
        return true;
    }
}
```
- Replace, in the controller factory, the action invoker for each concerned controller 
```C#
mvcController.ActionInvoker = new CustomControllerActionInvoker();
```

### Model Binding
It is the process that maps data from request to the method parameters.

When MVC receives an HTTP request, it routes it to a specific action method of a controller. It determines which action method to run based on what is in the route data, then it binds values from the HTTP request to that action method’s parameters. 

MVC will try to bind request data to the action parameters by name. MVC will look for values for each parameter using the parameter name and the names of its public settable properties. 

MVC uses DefaultModelBinder as a default model binder. It binds the following objects:
- Types primitifs, such as objets String, Double, Decimal et DateTime.
- Classes de modèle, such as Person, Address et Product.
- Collections, such as ICollection<T>, IList<T> et IDictionary<TKey, TValue>

To create a custom model binder, you need to:
- Create a class that derives from IModelBinder (or DefaultModelBinder)
```C#
public class CustomModelBinder : IModelBinder
{
    public object BindModel(ControllerContext controllerContext,
                            ModelBindingContext bindingContext)
    {
        var request = controllerContext.HttpContext.Request;

        var day = request.Form.Get("Day");
        var month = request.Form.Get("Month");
        var year = request.Form.Get("Year");

        return new DateModel
        {
            Date = day + "/" + month + "/" + year
        };
    }
}
```
- Register it in the ModelBinders in the Global.asax file
```C#
ModelBinders.Binders.Add(typeof(DateModel), new CustomModelBinder());
```

Model binding looks through default value providers, in the order, which are the components that feed data to model binders:
- Form values: These are form values that go in the HTTP request using the POST method. (including jQuery POST requests).
- Route values: The set of route values provided by routing.
- Query strings: The query string part of the URI.

To create a custom value providers, you need to:
- Create a class that derives from IValueProvider
```C#
public class CustomValueProvider: IValueProvider
{
    public bool ContainsPrefix(string prefix)
    {
        return HttpContext.Current.Request.Cookies[prefix] != null;
    }

    public ValueProviderResult GetValue(string key)
    {
        return new ValueProviderResult(
            HttpContext.Current.Request.Cookies[key].Value,
            HttpContext.Current.Request.Cookies[key].Value,
            CultureInfo.CurrentCulture);
    }
}
```
- Create a class that derives from ValueProviderFactory which will create the new value provider
```C#
public class CustomValueProviderFactory: ValueProviderFactory
{
    public override IValueProvider GetValueProvider(ControllerContext controllerContext)
    {
        return new CustomValueProvider();
    }
}
```
- Add the new value provider factory to the ValueProvidersFactories in Global.asax
```C#
ValueProviderFactories.Factories.Add(new CustomValueProviderFactory());
```

In order for binding to happen, the class must have a public default constructor and member to be bound must be public writable properties. When model binding happens the class will only be instantiated using the public default constructor, then the properties can be set.

When a parameter is bound, model binding stops looking for values with that name and it moves on to bind the next parameter. If binding fails, MVC does not throw an error. You can query for model state errors by checking the ModelState.IsValid property.

MVC contains several attributes that you can use to direct its default model binding behavior to a different source.
- BindRequired: add a model state error if binding cannot occur.
- BindNever: tells to the model binder to never bind this paramater.
- FromHeader: tells to Model binder to search the binding value from the request's header.
- FromQuery: tells to Model binder to search the binding value from the query string. 
- FromRoute: tells to Model binder to search the binding value from the route.
- FromForm: tells to Model binder to search the binding value from the from.
- FromServices: tells to Model binder to use DI (Dependency Injection) to bind the parameters from the Services.
- FromBody: tells to Model binder to search the binding value from request body. It uses configured formatter to bind the value from the body and formatter is defined in the content type of the request.
- ModelBinder: tells to Model binding to use custom model binder to bind the parameters. 

Request data can come in a variety of formats including JSON, XML and many others. When you use the [FromBody] attribute to indicate that you want to bind a parameter to data in the request body, MVC uses a configured set of formatters to handle the request data based on its content type. By default MVC includes a JsonInputFormatter class for handling JSON data, but you can add additional formatters for handling XML and other custom formats.

ASP.NET selects input formatters based on the Content-Type header and the type of the parameter.

### Filters
Filters are custom classes that provide both a declarative and programmatic means to add pre-action and post-action behavior to controller action methods.

#### Filter types
ASP.NET MVC supports the following types of action filters:
- Authentication filters: to implement authentication. It runs before any other filter or action method. These implement IAuthenticationFilter.
- Authorization filters: to implement authorization. It runs after the Authentication filter and before any other filter or action method. These implement IAuthorizationFilter.
- Action filters:  These implements IActionFilter. It runs before and after any action method. There are 2 events available:
  - OnActionExecuting - Runs before execution of Action method.
  - OnActionExecuted - Runs after execution of Action method.
- Result filters: These implements IResultFilter. It runs before and after execution of any action result. There are 2 events available:
  - OnResultExecuting - Runs before content is rendered to View.
  - OnResultExecuted - Runs after content is rendered to view.
- Exception filters: This filter is used to capture any exceptions if raised by controller or an action method. These implement IExceptionFilter.

#### Existing filters
Some filters are provided by Asp.Net implemented as attributes. The filters can be applied at the action method, controller, or application level.
- AuthorizeAttribute: Restricts access by authentication and optionally authorization. (customErrors element need to enabled in the Web.config file to work)
- HandleErrorAttribute: Specifies how to handle an exception that is thrown by an action method.
- OutputCacheAttribute: Provides output caching.
- RequireHttpsAttribute: Forces unsecured HTTP requests to be resent over HTTPS.

#### Filter creation
##### Override OnXXX methods
You can override one or more of controller's On<Filter> methods.
```C#
protected override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
{
    base.OnActionExecuting(filterContext);
    TempData["time"] = Stopwatch.StartNew();
}

protected override void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext filterContext)
{
    base.OnActionExecuted(filterContext);

    var stopWatch = TempData["time"] as Stopwatch;
    if (stopWatch != null)
    {
        stopWatch.Stop();

        var result = filterContext.Result as ViewResult;
        if (result != null)
        {
            ((FilterModel)result.Model).ExecutionTime = stopWatch.Elapsed.TotalMilliseconds;
        }
    }
}
```

##### Derive from ActionFilterAttribute
To create a new ActionFilterAttribute, you need to:
- Create a class that derives from ActionFilterAttribute
```C#
public class ExecutionActionFilterAtttribute: ActionFilterAttribute, IActionFilter
{
    private readonly Stopwatch stopWatch;

    public ExecutionActionFilterAtttribute()
    {
        stopWatch = new Stopwatch();
    }

    public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
    {
        stopWatch.Reset();
        stopWatch.Start();
    }

    public override void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext filterContext)
    {
        stopWatch.Stop();

        var result = filterContext.Result as ViewResult;
        if (result != null)
        {
            ((FilterModel)result.Model).ExecutionTime = stopWatch.Elapsed.TotalMilliseconds;
        }
    }
}
```
- Apply this attribute over the controller's method you want.
```C#
[ExecutionActionFilterAtttribute()]
[Route("FilterByCustomActionFilterAttribute", Name = "FilterByCustomActionFilterAttribute")]
public ActionResult FilterByCustomActionFilterAttribute()
{
    return View("Index", new FilterModel());
}
```

##### FilterProviders
You can register several provider in the FilterProviders.

By default, ASP.NET MVC registers the following filter providers:
- GlobalFilters.Filters for global filters.
- FilterAttributeFilterProvider for filter attributes.
- ControllerInstanceFilterProvider for controller instances.

To create a custom filter provider, you need to:
- Create a class that derives from IFilterProvider
```C#
public class CustomFilterProvider: IFilterProvider
{
    public IEnumerable<System.Web.Mvc.Filter> GetFilters(
        ControllerContext controllerContext, 
        ActionDescriptor actionDescriptor)
    {
        if (actionDescriptor.ControllerDescriptor.ControllerName == "TestFilter")
        {
            if (actionDescriptor.ActionName == "FilterByCustomFilterProvider")
            {
                yield return new System.Web.Mvc.Filter(new ExecutionActionFilterAtttribute(), FilterScope.Action, 0);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- Register this new provider in the provider collection
```C#
FilterProviders.Providers.Add(new CustomFilterProvider());
```

##### GlobalFilterCollection
To use GlobalFilters, you need to:
- Create a class that derives from IActionFilter, IAuthorizedAttribute, IExceptionAttribute or IResultAttribute
```C#
public class CustomGlobalFilter: IActionFilter
{
    private readonly Stopwatch stopWatch;

    public CustomGlobalFilter()
    {
        stopWatch = new Stopwatch();
    }

    public void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext)
    {
        stopWatch.Reset();
        stopWatch.Start();
    }

    public void OnActionExecuted(ActionExecutedContext filterContext)
    {
        stopWatch.Stop();

        if (filterContext.ActionDescriptor.ControllerDescriptor.ControllerName == "TestFilter")
        {
            if (filterContext.ActionDescriptor.ActionName == "FilterByGlobalFilter")
            {
                var result = filterContext.Result as ViewResult;
                if (result != null)
                {
                    ((FilterModel)result.Model).ExecutionTime = stopWatch.Elapsed.TotalMilliseconds;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- Register this new provider in the global filter collection
```C#
GlobalFilters.Filters.Add(new CustomGlobalFilter());
```

#### Filter order
Filters run in the following order:
- Authentication filters
- Authorization filters
- Action filters
- Result filters
- Exception filters

#### Filter scope
Within each filter type, the Order value specifies the run order. Within each filter type and order, the Scope enumeration value specifies the order for filters. This enumeration defines the following filter scope values (in the order in which they run):
- First: specifies first.
- Global: specifies an order before Controller and after First.
- Controller: specifies an order before Action and after Global.
- Action: specifies an order before Last and after Controller.
- Last: specifies last.

#### Filter cancellation
You can cancel filter execution in the OnActionExecuting and OnResultExecuting methods by setting the Result property to a non-null value.
```C#
public override void OnActionExecuting(ActionExecutingContext filterContext) 
{ 
    filterContext.Result = new EmptyResult();
}
```
### Validations
Validations allow to validate data input by the user. MVC propose validation technics for both client and server side.

#### Client side
The validations happen on users' browser and before the data gets posted back to the server.

##### Unobtrusive validation
Client side validation that don't need to write a ton of validation code. You just need to use the JQuery Validate Plugin and the Unobtrusive library.

Unobtrusive Validation allows us to take the already-existing validation attributes and use them client-side.

To enable it, you need to add the following configuration in the Global.asax file (or Web.config)
```C#
HtmlHelper.ClientValidationEnabled = true;
HtmlHelper.UnobtrusiveJavaScriptEnabled = true;
```

or

```xml
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="ClientValidationEnabled" value="false"/> 
    <add key="UnobtrusiveJavaScriptEnabled" value="false"/> 
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
```

##### IClientValidatable
This interface allows to enable client side validation on custom data annotation.

To use this validation on client side, you need to:
- Create a class that derives from ValidationAttribute and IClientValidatable
```C#
public class ExcludeCharsAttribute: ValidationAttribute, IClientValidatable
{
    private readonly string chars;

    public ExcludeCharsAttribute(string chars)
        : base("The field {0} contains invalid character.")
    {
        this.chars = chars;
    }

    protected override ValidationResult IsValid(object value, ValidationContext validationContext)
    {
        if (value != null)
        {
            var valueAsString = value.ToString();
            for (var i = 0; i < chars.Length; i++)
            {
                if (valueAsString.Contains(chars[i]))
                {
                    var errorMessage = FormatErrorMessage(validationContext.DisplayName);
                    return new ValidationResult(errorMessage);
                }
            }
        }
        return ValidationResult.Success;
    }

    public IEnumerable<ModelClientValidationRule> GetClientValidationRules(ModelMetadata metadata, ControllerContext context)
    {
        var rule = new ModelClientValidationRule();
        rule.ErrorMessage = FormatErrorMessage(metadata.GetDisplayName());
        rule.ValidationParameters.Add("chars", chars);
        rule.ValidationType = "exclude";
        yield return rule;
    }
}
```
- Apply this new data annotation to the property you want to validate with
```C#
[ExcludeChars("0123456789")]
public string Name { get; set; }
```
- Create a new javascript file to add this new validation as an unobtrusive validation
```javascript

$.validator.unobtrusive.adapters.addSingleVal("exclude", "chars");
$.validator.addMethod("exclude", function (value, element, exclude) {
    if (value) {

            if (jQuery.inArray(exclude[i], value) != -1) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
});
```
- Add this new javascript file in the bundle collection
```C#
bundles.Add(new ScriptBundle("~/bundles/jqueryval").Include(
                             "~/Scripts/jquery.validate*",
                             "~/Scripts/excludeValidation.js"));
```

#### Server side 
##### Data Annotation
It is an attribute which can be apply to the class' properties to apply a validation. It allow to do a single validation.

To create a custom data annotation, you need to:
- Create a class that implement ValidationAttribute
```C#
public class ExcludeCharsAttribute: ValidationAttribute
{
    private readonly string chars;

    public ExcludeCharsAttribute(string chars)
        : base("The field {0} contains invalid character.")
    {
        this.chars = chars;
    }

    protected override ValidationResult IsValid(object value, ValidationContext validationContext)
    {
        if (value != null)
        {
            var valueAsString = value.ToString();
            for (var i = 0; i < chars.Length; i++)
            {
                if (valueAsString.Contains(chars[i]))
                {
                    var errorMessage = FormatErrorMessage(validationContext.DisplayName);
                    return new ValidationResult(errorMessage);
                }
            }
        }
        return ValidationResult.Success;
    }
}
```
- Apply this custom data annotation to the property of a class you want to validate with.
```C#
[ExcludeChars("0123456789")]
public string Name { get; set; }
```
##### IValidatableObject
It allows to implement some validation directly in the model class itself which may need to span multiple property values. It allow to do a multiple validations.

To integrate validation in the object model, you need to:
- Create an object model that derives IValidatableObject
 ```C#
public class ValidationModel: IValidatableObject
{
    public int? Income { get; set; }

    public bool HasSalary { get; set; }

    public IEnumerable<ValidationResult> Validate(ValidationContext validationContext)
    {
        if (HasSalary && (!Income.HasValue || Income < 0))
        {
            yield return new ValidationResult("The field Income cannot be negative", new[] { "Income" });
        }
    }
}
```

### Passing Data
#### Passing Data Between a Controller and a View
To pass data to the view, you can:
- Use the ViewData property which returns a ViewDataDictionary object that has case-insensitive string keys. It requires typecasting for complex data type and check for null values to avoid error.
```C#
ViewData["key"] = value
```
- Use the ViewBag property which is a dynamic property that takes advantage of the new dynamic features in C# 4.0. ViewBag doesn’t require typecasting for complex data type.
```C#
ViewBag.key = value
```

#### Passing State between Action Methods
An action method can store data in the controller's TempDataDictionary object before it calls the controller's RedirectToAction method to invoke the next action. The TempData property value is stored in session state. Any action method that is called after the TempDataDictionary value is set can get values from the object and then process or display them. The value of TempData persists until it is read or until the session times out.
```C#
TempData["key"] = value
```

## Result Execution
![Result Execution](./img/result-execution.png)

It is the step where the result is sent back to the browser.

Once the action result has been prepared, the result execution step starts. At this point, the Result Filters are executed before and after the result execution. 

The result filters consist of two events:
- OnResultExecuting: filter executed before the result execution.
- OnResultExecuted: filter executed after the result execution. This is the last point in the request lifecycle.

The result execution branches in to two separate routes. If the result is View Engine, the appropriate view engine Razor, ASPX or custom view engine is used to render partial view or view. If the Response is any other type, then it is sent directly without using any view engine.

### Action Result
MVC propose some existing action result:
- ContentResult: returns a user-define content type.
- JSonResult: returns a serialized JSON object.
- EmptyResult: represents a return value that is used if the action method must return a null result.
- ViewResult: renders a view as Web page.
- PartialViewResult: renders a partial view, which defines a section of a view that can be rendered inside another view.
- FileResult returns a binary output to write to the response.
- JavaScriptResult: returns a script that can be executed on the client.
- RedirectResult: redirects to another action method by using its URL.
- RedirectToRouteResult: redirects to another action method.

To create a custom action result, you need to:
- Create a class that derives from ActionResult
```C#
public class XmlActionResult: ActionResult
{
    private readonly ResultModel model;

    public XmlActionResult(ResultModel model)
    {
        this.model = model;
    }

    public override void ExecuteResult(ControllerContext context)
    {
        var httpContext = context.HttpContext;
        httpContext.Response.Buffer = true;
        httpContext.Response.Clear();

        var response = context.HttpContext.Response;
        response.ContentType = "application/xml";

        using (var writer = new StringWriter())
        {
            var xml = new XmlSerializer(typeof(ResultModel));
            xml.Serialize(writer, model);
            httpContext.Response.Write(writer);
        }
    }
}
```
- Use this new action result as a return type in a controller's method
```C#
[HttpPost]
[Route("TestActionResult", Name = "TestActionResult_Post")]
public ActionResult TestActionResult(string message)
{
    var model = new ResultModel();
    model.Message = message;
    return new XmlActionResult(model);
}
```

### View Engine
There are two view engines that MVC provides by default, Razor View Engine and Legacy View Engine (ASPX View Engine). Razor view engine is more sophisticated and fast compared to Legacy engine. 

To create a custom view engine, you need to:
- Create a class that derives from IViewEngine
```C#
public class MyViewEngine : IViewEngine
{
    public ViewEngineResult FindPartialView(ControllerContext controllerContext, string partialViewName, bool useCache)
    {
        //Finds the partial view by using the controller context.
        return null;
    }

    public ViewEngineResult FindView(ControllerContext controllerContext, string viewName, string masterName, bool useCache)
    {
        //Finds the view by using the controller context.
        return null;
    }

    public void ReleaseView(ControllerContext controllerContext, IView view)
    {
        //Releases the view by using the controller context.
    }
}
```
- Register this custom view engine in the engines collection in the Global.Asax file
```C#
ViewEngines.Engines.Clear(); // prevent to have several view engine
ViewEngines.Engines.Add(new MyViewEngine());
```

# Http Module

It is an assembly that is called on every request that is made to your application.

You can override the default behavior or add custom logic by letting you attach event handlers to HttpApplication events. 

To create a custom http handler, we need to
- Create a class that derives from IHttpModule
```C#
public class MyHttpModule: IHttpModule
{
    private bool disposed;
    private HttpApplication context;

    public void Init(HttpApplication context)
    {
        this.context = context;

        // With the context with have access to all http application events
        context.BeginRequest += OnBeginRequest;
    }

    private void OnBeginRequest(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        // CODE HERE
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    private void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (disposing)
        {
            if (!disposed)
            {
                context.BeginRequest -= OnBeginRequest;
                disposed = false;
            }
        }
    }
} 
```
- Create a class that register the new http module
```C#
public static class MyHttpModuleRegistration
{
    public static void Initialize()
    {
        DynamicModuleUtility.RegisterModule(typeof(MyHttpModule));
    }
}
```
- Run the registration before application start by adding the following line in the AssemblyInfo.cs
```C#
[assembly: PreApplicationStartMethod(typeof(MyHttpModuleRegistration), "Initialize")]
```
